# Mips Assembly Examples
[QtSpim](http://spimsimulator.sourceforge.net) simulator is used to run these mips programs.

## Example 1
It takes a string and a char as inputs, and counts the number of input char in the string.<br/>
An example for you to see how it works:<br/>

## Example 2
It computes the sum of N numbers such that each sum skips over certain numbers. In the code of example 2, there is a list
of numbers which is indicated as 'numbers'. Assume your choice to skip number is 3, then this will find the
summation of Number 1 + Number 4 + Number 7 ...

## Example 3
It reads the elements of an array and prints the uppercase characters represented by the integers in the array. 0
represents space, and each integer from 1 to 26 corresponds to an uppercase letter in English alphabet.

## Example 4
It determines the height of a binary tree. It takes the length and the elements of the array as 
inputs.
